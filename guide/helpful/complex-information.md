## Description

Provide additional explanatory content for information that is complex, especially if it is important for successful completion of a task.

## How it helps

Users should be able understand the content they find and successfully complete any tasks without requiring further external assistance.
If complex information cannot be understood people may be unable to complete the task they are trying to perform or may experience significant delay and frustration while they try to find help. If the user perceives the activity to be too complex the user may decide to abandon the activity and therefore be excluded from the information and/or services derived from the completion of an activity.

## More details

Common tasks that could be affected include finding answers sought on a website, and completing an online process to make a transaction required by a service.

The complexity may be inherent in the information itself. In which case it is likely to need careful explanation for all users. Alternatively, presentation of the information such as a graph may obscure it’s meaning through complexity. In this case, a supporting description and interpretation will highlight the relevance and interpretation of the key features being presented.

Help may be provided in various forms, for example

- Text Boxes providing explanation and help
- Explanations of Keywords.
- A supporting chart or graph to illuminate text content
- Guide to interpreting data in a chart or graph
- A supplemental table – as long as it is not itself complex

## Examples

### Success example

Tooltips provide help for keywords and jargon

### Failure example:

A complex graph of data with no guide to interpretation.
