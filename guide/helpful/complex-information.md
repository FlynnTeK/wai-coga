## Description

Provide additional explanatory content for information that is complex, especially if it is data or explains a process.

## User Story

*! Split into 3 Patterns? Move to objective 3? !*

- I can understand complex content as contextually-relevant graphs, pictures and tables are provided to supplement it
- I can understand complex tables or graphs as extra help is provided to explain the important features
- I can understand a multi stage process as help is provided for all stages and the sequence is always clear

## What To Do

Provide additional help content that explains any complex information, data and processes. It may be provided in various forms, for example:

- Text "asides" providing explanation and help
- A supporting chart or graph to illuminate text content
- A supplemental table – as long as it is not itself complex
- Popup on hover explanations of keywords - possibly linked to a glossary
- A guide to interpreting data in a chart or graph
- A flow chart of steps in a process

## How It Helps

This Pattern builds on help related WCAG Success Criteria to ensure users are effectively supported in understanding complex content.

Users should be able understand the content they find and successfully complete described tasks without requiring further external assistance. If content is sufficiently complex then it may be inaccessible without the provision of additional supporting help.

## More details

The complexity may be inherent in the information itself, for example the language used, the quantity of information, or the subject matter. In this case, it is likely to need very careful explanation and organisation for all users to be able to understand without any mistakes, confusion or need of assistance. 

Alternatively, the presentation mode of information such as a graph or table may obscure it’s meaning through complexity. Here, a supporting description and guided interpretation will highlight the the key features the user needs to understand.

## Examples, Techniques and Requirements

Success Examples:

- The explanation of a medical procedure and success rate statistics is amplified though the use of an additional text aside, a diagram and a graph.

- A graph and data table of sales figures has the key features that relate to the content clearly explained.

- The multi step process for applying for a visa is made made easier to use by adding flow chart of all the steps that is always visible. Each step in the flowchart has links to extra help and the current step is clearly highlighted.

Failure Examples:

- A complex graph is shown with no guide to interpretation.
