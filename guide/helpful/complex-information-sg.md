  Testing a format different to the current DG one that builds on existing SCs, techniques and guidelines.
  Also exploring possible format for [Supplemental Guidance](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website/issues/132)

  Thought "Intent" + "Benefit" => "How it Heps"

## Description

Provide additional explanatory content for information that is complex, especially if it is important for successful completion of a task.

## User Experience

This quote from a persona (fictional person) helps you understand some aspects of this guidance.

# Intent

Some users find complex information very hard to understand or confusing, even if written using "good" language. For example it may be hard to remember previous content.

If the information is required in order to preform a task then the complexity may act as a barrier to performing that task. Common tasks that could be affected include finding answers sought on a website and completing an online process to make a transaction required by a service.

The complexity may be inherent in the information itself, for example the language used, the quanity of information, or the subject matter itself. In this case, it is likely to need very careful explanation for all users to be able to understand without any mistakes or confusion. Alternatively, presentation of the information such as a graph may obscure it’s meaning through complexity. In this case, a supporting description and guided interpretation will highlight the the key features the user needs to understand.

WCAG provides a number of Success Criteria designed to ensure that various mechanisms of providing help work well for all users. The intent of this pattern (SG?) is to ensure the help is relevent for the user's need in understanding complex information.  

# Benefits

Improves understanding for all users and is likely to answer any questions or avoid mis understandings that could stop the user performing a task.

# What To Do

Provide help content that explains any complex information. It may be provided in various forms, for example:

- Static "Text Boxes" providing explanation and help
- Popup on hover explanations of keywords.
- A supporting chart or graph to illuminate text content
- Guide to interpreting data in a chart or graph
- A supplemental table – as long as it is not itself complex
- A flow chart of steps in a process

# Examples

The UK Gov provide an online facility to [apply for a study visa](https://www.gov.uk/study-visit-visa). The information and process are very complex, with many conditions but are clearly written. Even so, a [step by step help guide](https://www.gov.uk/apply-short-term-study-visa) is provided to guide the user through the complexities and successfully complete the process from start to finish.
