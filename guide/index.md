## Overview

Techniques that make websites and applications friendly for people with cognitive impairments need to be addressed in every part of a design and development process.

Traditionally accessibility has been most focused on the interface and making that usable for people with sensory and physical impairments. For example, technical accessibility techniques for vision, hearing and/or mobility. Some of these accessibility techniques will also be effective in helping people with cognitive impairments.

Often however, cognitive barriers are caused by context, language, usability, and other more general 'design' factors. So, these need to be addressed during the early design stages of user interface development and during content creation. Following good design Patters benefits everyone to some degree, but bad design patterns can completely stop someone with congitive and learning disabilities.

This guide presents a number of effective design **Patterns** which when applied, will make a significant contribution to ensuring good cognitive accessibility and also improve wider usability. The Patterns are gouped into design **Objectives** which each cover an important area of cognitive accessibility. In addition to the Patterns, each Objective includes information on user testing and example user stories. Just understanding the Objectives and user stories may enable better design decisions to be made. But, the Patterns provide practical steps that can be applied to a design process so content is more accessible to people with cognitive and learning disabilities.

## Objectives

- **[Understandable](./understandable/) - Users understand what elements are and how to use them**
- **[Findable](./understandable) - Users can find what they need**
- **[Readable](./understandable) - Use clear and understandable content and text**
- **[Amendable](./amendable) - Prevent user from making mistakes and make it easy to correct**
- **[Indispensable](./indeispensable) - Help the user focus and restore context if attention is lost**
- **[Conceivable](./conceivable) - Processes do not rely on memory**
- **[Supportable](./supportable) -Provide help and support**
- **[Adaptable](./adaptable) - Adaptable and Personalisable**
