*Note: Currently this is largely an outline view. However, Items marked with (\*) do have some example content.*

## Overview

Users with cognitive impairments may need different levels and forms of help, depending on their circumstances. Note that a lot can be achieved through supporting personalization.

## User Testing

Make sure your user testing has all the different cognitive disabilities represented. (Make sure people don't just   ask these as questions, but ask something that demonstrates it.)

Test for the following  :

- Identify the different activities
  - Test that the users can achieve the activities without asking for help
  - Does the user make errors trying to achieve the activities
  - Does the user find them easy to achieve
  - Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or tiered
  - Ask the user what might help if they were stressed or tired. If they do not have ideas ask them about the design guidance bellow and if any of them would help them for this content. Ask them for other idea
- Can the user find help?
  - Does the user make errors trying to find help?
  - Does the user find them easy to achieve?
  
## User Stories

This leads to the following user stories.

- I know how to find out more, such as context-sensitive help or tooltips.
- I need to easily get human help.
- I need symbols that help me understand.
- Help and main content should be clearly differentiated so I do not confuse them.
- I need contextually-relevant graphs and pictures to supplement text so I can understand a point without a lot of - reading.
- I need speech support, with synchronized highlighting, so I can follow as I go.
- I need rapid feedback.
- I need more space between letters, words, sentences, and/or lines of text.
- I need more space between letters, words, sentences, and/or lines of text.● I need more space between letters, - words, sentences, and/or lines of text.
- I need reminders, or I will forget appointments and when I was meant to do things.
- I do not want too many reminders as I will be distracted.
- I want to be confident that I can manage my tasks.

## provide Human Help

- Ensure easy access to a human who can provide help and support.
- Support can be on accessibility, technical, process or domain based.
- Access to human help should never require the user to manage complex menu systems such as voice menus with different options.

### How it helps

In cases where the user gets stuck or confused for any reason, contact with a human is usually the most effective and suitable solution. Otherwise the user may abandon the process and be left with negative attitude towards the service or supplier.

One or more contact mechanisms should be easy to locate and use from any page or any step in a process.

### More details

Examples include

- An option for live chat or video call help. Note: It must be full accessible and easy to close new windows that open as part of live help functionality.
- A phone number, ideally with a feature to automatically call via an interoperable Voice over IP specification.
- A simple site contact form.
- An email link using the ‘mailto’ protocol with prefilled “to” and “subject” fields. Note will not work on all platforms or depending of the users mail client
- Use available standards to get human help for example, using the 0 digit on voice menu systems

It is important that voice communication is easy and this implies the person providing help can both be easily understood and is able to understand others, allowing for a range of vocal and verbal characteristics. Sensitivity to the requirements of people with learning cognitive disabilities is also important.

#### WCAG

- [WCAG 3.3.5 Help: Context-sensitive help is available](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#minimize-error-context-help) (Level AAA)] Note for coga global help should be provided as well as context sensitive [?]
- [WCAG G71: Providing a help link on every Web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/complete.html#G71) Note for coga, help should be available on every page, not just forms.
- WCAG G193 Providing help by an assistant in the Web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G193.htmlhttps://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G193.html) NB !!! There is often a mixture of suitable WCAG links (SC, quick ref, Techniques & Understanding). I picked the SC plus others even though they can all be found via the SC
