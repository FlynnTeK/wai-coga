## Use Cases / Persona

Any time there is a 'target audience', there will be people with with learning and cognitive disabilities in that audience. Cogntiive issues are often invisible in day to day life until people encounter particular challenges. To provide some context and understanding eight personas have been created which outline fictional people with various cognitive issues and the challenges they face.

## Differences from usability testing with the general population

There are some differences when testing for accessibility, and that includes when testing with people who have cognitive impairments:

- Ensure that the participation forms are easy to understand, send them to the participant in advance, and allow plenty of time for the participant to ask questions and fill in forms;

- Allow the participant to bring a carer, family member or friend to attend with them. If your tester has a guardian you should get informed consent from both the tester and their guardian;

- It helps to provide easy methods of assessing mood, rather than asking for the participant to verbalise, try asking them to select a smiley face, such as:
    a set of 5 smiley faces from happy, through neutral, to sad.

- Ensure the person does not feel like they are at fault for making mistakes; this is a likely scenario for people with cognitive impairments.

## Design Themes

To help web content providers meet the needs of people with cognitive and learning disabilities we have identified the a number of themes. These can be explored in the [[Developer Guide](./guide?view=themes)]
