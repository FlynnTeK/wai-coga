## Use Cases / Persona

Any time there is a 'target audience', there will be people with with learning and cognitive disabilities in that audience. Cogntiive issues are often invisible in day to day life until people encounter particular challenges. To provide some context and understanding eight personas have been created which outline fictional people with various cognitive issues and the challenges they face.

## Glossary of Terms

The are many terms used arround Cognitive and Learning Disabilities, many of which vary between countries. 

We are compiling a [Glossary of Terms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1poEoQjuWdAfWM3aOGPCwJRx7EvBsAtQ_99sGyS9Jlgc/edit).

## Differences from usability testing with the general population

There are some differences when testing for accessibility, and that includes when testing with people who have cognitive impairments:

- Ensure that the participation forms are easy to understand, send them to the participant in advance, and allow plenty of time for the participant to ask questions and fill in forms;

- Allow the participant to bring a carer, family member or friend to attend with them. If your tester has a guardian you should get informed consent from both the tester and their guardian;

- It helps to provide easy methods of assessing mood, rather than asking for the participant to verbalise, try asking them to select a smiley face, such as:
    a set of 5 smiley faces from happy, through neutral, to sad.

- Ensure the person does not feel like they are at fault for making mistakes; this is a likely scenario for people with cognitive impairments

## Designing for Cognitive and Learning Disabilities

The wide variation of user requirements of people with cognitive and learning disabilities requires extra in design to avoid introducing access blocking barriers. In particular, care is needed with, structure, navigation, dynamics and especially content. 

- There are many usesful techniques which can be grouped into the following Themes so they are more manageable:
- Ensure design is easy to understand and use
- Help the user find what they need
- Use clear and understandable content
- Prevent mistakes and provide easy correction
- Help the user focus and restore context if distracted
- Avoid creating cognitive barriers
- Provide Help and Support
- Provide feedback that is usable by everyone
- The Design page covers these in detail.

Any individual is likely to have their own personal requirements for good cognitive accessibility. In addition, they may require other accessibility considerations such as those for low vision. In order to have any possibility of providing a workable personal experience some form personalisation according to user preferences is required. Personalisation is thus particularly import when designing accessibility for cognitive and learning disabilities. This will allow all users to select how they individually experience and interact with the design, better matching their personal coping mechanisms and other requirements.

## Design Themes

To help web content providers meet the needs of people with cognitive and learning disabilities we have identified the a number of themes. These can be explored in the [[Developer Guide](./guide?view=themes)]
