  This is the overall plan for moving coga resources to the WAI Website. 
  
  Each proposed page also has it's own Design Box at the top of the page.

- Coga TF [F2F meeting information](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Meetings/Jan_2019)

## Reasoning

Currently, the many Coga resources are a mixture of TR Notes, GitHub Issues and more.
Several are very large and the fixed document format of TR Notes can be difficult to read.
Moving to the WAI Web site offers the following opportunities

- Easily discovered resources as they coexist with other accessibility information where people are looking
- Better organise existing content, including taking advantage of existing WAI information architecture
- Flexibility to provide better formats. For example can be interactive so easier to navigate and read
- Links can enhance the user experience without cuaing a jump between the very different web and TR document formats
- More control over editoral process including review access and publishing cadence
- Can 'dog food' coga and personalisation

## Primary Stakeholders

### Creators & Consultants

- Understand broad user requirements
- Meet SCs required for desired conformance
- Learn techniques and best practices
- Able to evaluate and remediate short comings

### Standard Makers

- Gain detailed understanding of user requirements, both specific and commonalities
- Identify techniques and technologies that support users as well as gaps that need to be filled
- Be confident that existing and newly developed standard clauses successfully meet coga user requirements 

### Researchers

- Gain an overview of current corpus
- Identify opportunities for further research
- Confident of evidence base for stated requirements and approaches

## Secondary Stakeholders

### Policy Makers

- Confident in understanding key user requirements
- Ensure Policy is representative and fit for purpose

## Editoral process

- Source in GitHub repository - wai-coga
- TF will provide updates via a coga-fiendly contribution channel
  - Could be google docs
- Editor (Steve) will take input from TF and merge into source
  - Use feature branch and PR to isolate changes
  - Commit to master causes push to w3c.github.io
  - Provide previews for TF review with links to https://w3c.github.io/wai-coga/
