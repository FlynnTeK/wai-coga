## Introduction

*Explain Personas*

## Anna a Student who has Dyslexia

Anna has been as student for the past year. Her Fashion Design course has been challenging but fun. She loves the creative aspect of the diploma and would rather be drawing than writing. She has moderate dyslexia, which affects her ability to read, spell and use numbers.

Anna had several projects to complete as part of her portfolio, but the one that worried her most involved a written assignment where she has to research the topic of Post-war fashions and their impact on today’s designs.

### Challenge 1: Finding technology to support password protection and support.

Her use of the library catalogue from home failed at the first attempt when she could not remember her password and kept putting in ‘afib61’ rather than ‘afid16’ and could not see the mistakes. The error message on the web page had not helped by announcing that her user name or password were incorrect and she was not sure which one was incorrect. Luckily, as she was on her own laptop the browser settings allowed her to save her password and she was able to check where she had made the mistake.

### Challenge 2: knowing documentation is accessible

Having navigated the online library system, Anna eventually found a paper on the subject but when she went to download the file she found it was in pdf format. She was hoping to use her text to speech app to have the content read aloud but when she tried to highlight the text nothing happened. She discovered the document was actually an image and yet there was no warning this was the case and she could not find an alternative accessible version of the paper. This meant she had to use optical character recognition to virtually scan the paper. It was not totally successful and took away valuable time from her writing.

### Challenge 3: Filling in a form to ask for an ejournal article

Finally, Anna found an ejournal that had another article but there was a form that had to be completed. Anna duly started the process but realised she did not know the author’s name. She returned to the page where she had found the article to copy and paste the name. Sadly when she returned to the form all that she had filled in was lost. She had hoped to just be able to add the final bit, not have to retype the whole thing again.
