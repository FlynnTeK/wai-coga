# Cognitive and Learning Disabilities

Cognitive and learning disabilities include long-term and and sometimes permanent difficulties relating to cognitive functions, such as:

- perception, memory and attention 
- learning and orientation 
- visual, verbal and numerical thinking

These are usually hidden difficulties and may be age related. The terminology and definitions used for cognitive disabilities varies between countries and users are less likely to have a formal diagnosis of a disability than individuals with physical and sensory difficulties.  Cognitive disabilities may include intellectual impairments affecting comprehension alongside written and spoken expression. People may also experience a  co-occurrence of difficulties such as dyspraxia / developmental coordination difficulties and ADHD should also be taken into account. 

It should be noted that by addressing barriers to accessibility for users with cognitive and learning disabilities, improvements to digital technologies can be achieved and there is the potential to improve user experience for everyone.
