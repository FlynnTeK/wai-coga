## W3C WAI COGA Activity {#intro}

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international consortium that develops web standards. W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) focuses on making the web accessible to people with disabilities. 

W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) maintains a number for resources that directly support web accessibility for people with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities. In addition, other standards are reviewed to ensure they also provide suitable support and do not present barriers. This work is carried out by members of the **[Accessible Platform Architectures (APA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/)** working group through the specialist activities of the **[Cognitive Accessibility and Learning Disabilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/)** and **[Personalization Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/personalization/)** task forces.

## Other Relevant W3C WAI Activities

Other WAI Standards that are particularly relevant for cognitive and learning disabilities include:

### [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)

WCAG materials include guidelines and techniques for making websites and web applications work better for people with disabilities, including some that support people with cognitive and learning disabilities.

### [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/)

UAAG explains how to make web browsers and media players accessible. Some browser features are particularly important to people with cognitive and learning disabilities as the distinction between chrome and document may not be understood. For example, allowing personalization through specifying preferences.

### [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/)

Authoring tools are used to create web content. Examples of authoring tools are HTML editors and Web content management systems (CMS). These need to be both accessible to people with cognitive disabilities, and also must create content that is also fully accessible. In addition, the ability to allow authors to provide content alternatives supporting personalisation. (!!!)

### Other standards
Some other standards are highly relevant - eg [Web Authentication](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) can be a barrier if passwords are required.
