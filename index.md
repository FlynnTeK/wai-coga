People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities can experience a wide range of barriers to using technology.
Designing products that avoid such barriers requires careful attention content as well as technical accessibility.

This page provides a guide to the W3C WAI resources on Cognitive and Learning Disabilities.

W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) maintains a number for resources that support web accessibility for people with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities. This work is carried out by members of the **Accessibility Guidelines** and **Education and Outreach Working Groups** through the specialist activities of the **Cognitive Accessibility and Learning Disabilities** and **Personalization** task forces

This page provides a guide to the most suitable resources for specific uses.

* Develop Web sites that are inclusive of people with cognitive disabilities
* Ensure resources designed for people with COGA are usable
* Develop policies that are fully inclusive of people with cognitive disabilities
* Create technical standards that include cognitive disability requirements
